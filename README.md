# Human-Value-Detection

The following project involves developing an NLP system which can detect human values present in the text. Human values include self-enhancement, self-direction, openness to change, etc. To achieve this task, many ML algorithms including SVM, hierarchical classification models, and decision trees were used. Language models like BERT and RoBERTa were also employed, with RoBERTa yielding the best results. Mistral 7-B has also been fine-tuned for the above task.
